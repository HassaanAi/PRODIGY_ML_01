## Project Overview

In this project, we develop a machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices. We follow the standard process of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to derive meaningful insights and accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains housing information. It includes various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other relevant details to predict the house price.

- **Dataset Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices
- **Main Features**:
  - House size
  - Number of rooms
  - Location
  - Age of the house
  - Any other relevant features

## Process

### 1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded and structured for further analysis.

### 2. Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of the data, check for missing values, and analyze the relationships between the features.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features, are conducted to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling.

### 4. Feature Engineering
New features may be created based on existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

### 5. Building the Linear Regression Model
The Linear Regression model is built and trained on the processed dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
